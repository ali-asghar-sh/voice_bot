A bot that can speak out any given text. 


Found a Huggingface AI bot that can read out any text. 

The AI bot does not require internet, it is a standalone ML. 

Also does not require any API, or API key for Huggingface. 

Tried using it in Google Colab, it worked beautifully. 

Now trying to see if it can be integrated into a local LLM too.
